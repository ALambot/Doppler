# Doppler

Doppler is a WoW AddOn written in LUA by Prosper, using the Ace3 Framework.

Doppler allows the user to enter chat commands and automatically executes them every X seconds, with X a given period between 0.5 and 1000 seconds. Each command has its own period.

Doppler provides a simple GUI that allows the user to :
- create one or multiple _"Dop"_
- run them/stop them
- see the remaining time to the next execution with a nice progress bar
- delete them
- minimize the GUI to save screen space

Be careful when placing GameObjects with it or you might end up with hundreds of them everywhere. Still, I might or might not have another AddOn to delete them all at once.

Doppler was designed for the community of Kuretar, a French MJ-RP WoW server.
